# Vibe Oracle

A mystical mood divination experience. Answer abstract questions, receive cosmic wisdom.

## What Is This?

You know those moments when you need guidance but regular advice feels too... practical? The Vibe Oracle operates on a different frequency. It asks questions like "What color is your anxiety today?" and tells you your spirit animal is The Overthinking Octopus.

It's astrology for people who don't believe in astrology but still read their horoscope.

## Features

- **Vibe Assessment**: Answer 5 increasingly unhinged questions
- **Spirit Animal**: Discover your current spiritual essence (spoiler: it's probably anxious)
- **Cosmic Reading**: Receive mysteriously accurate observations about your life
- **Vibe Percentage**: Know exactly how vibing you are (usually 73-89%)
- **Unsolicited Advice**: The universe has opinions

## The Experience

1. Click "Consult the Oracle"
2. Answer questions about textures, colors, and existential burdens
3. Wait while the void buffers
4. Receive your reading
5. Feel seen in a weird way

## Sample Output

> **Spirit Animal: The Philosophical Crow**
> You collect shiny thoughts. You see patterns others miss. You're probably right about that thing.
>
> **Reading**: You're in your velvet era. This is neither good nor bad—it simply is.
>
> **Cosmic Advice**:
> - That thing you're procrastinating? It will take 15 minutes.
> - The call is coming from inside the house. The house is your own brain.
> - Be delusional in your self-belief. The odds are made up anyway.

## Run It

```bash
pip install flask
python app.py
# Open http://localhost:5010
```

## Why?

Because sometimes you need permission to be unserious. Because horoscopes are fun even when they're fake. Because "what texture is your mental state" is a valid question and "wet sand" is a valid answer.
